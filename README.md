# CTC
Matlab code for paper on attention and CTC: scope and limitations
Please see the referring paper for details about how this code was
used for simulations of a mechanism to increase phase coherence in
the gamma range in simulated cortical areas by adding phase-matched
alpha oscillations from simulated pulvinar areas.
